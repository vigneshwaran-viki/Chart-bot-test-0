    </p>

    <br><h1>Schedule appointments</h1>
<p>All business types, ranging from healthcare organization to home maintenance providers, can benefit from leveraging chatbots to schedule and modify customers’ appointments.<br> <br>Chatbots are linked to the organization’s calendar to provide the customer with information about available staff and time slots, as well as allow them to book appointments without <br><br>needing to contact front desks.</p>
<h1><br>Book tickets</h1>
Chatbots can guide the customer through the process of purchasing tickets for activities and events such as conferences, concerts, shows, tours, etc.

<br><br>For example, in 2017, Shell, the multinational oil and gas company, used a Facebook Messenger chatbot to sell tickets to their annual Shell Eco Marathon <br><br>where engineers and students compete to build an energy-efficient vehicle. The event was attended by 25,000 visitors.
